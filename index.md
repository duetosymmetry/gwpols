# Gravitational-wave polarizations

Like electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves (GWs) come in two distinct polarization states. These can be parametrized in a number of ways---we illustrate a few examples below.

## The linear basis

GW polarizations are usually represented in the **linear basis** of plus ($$+$$) and cross ($$\times$$) states, which are typically illustrated by their effect on a freely-falling ring of particles.
