# Gravitational-wave polarizations

Like electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves (GWs) come in two distinct polarization states. These can be parametrized in a number of ways---we illustrate a few examples below.

## The linear basis

GW polarizations are usually represented in the **linear polarization basis** of plus ($$+$$) and cross ($$\times$$) states, which are typically illustrated by their instantaneous effect on a freely-falling ring of particles, as shown below.

In these figures, the GW propagates in the _z_ direction, in or out of the screen, deforming the original ring (dotted circle) into ellipsoidal patterns shown at half-period intervals (solid and dashed).

## The circular basis

For monochromatic GWs, just as in the case of electromagnetic waves, we can also define a **circular polarization basis**, composed of right and left handed modes.
